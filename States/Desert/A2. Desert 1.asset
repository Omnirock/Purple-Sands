  storyText: 'You set your sights on the lights in the distance and start walking. 
    The desert seems to stretch on forever as the last of the daylight starts to
    fade and the air grows colder. The lights in the distance seem no closer now
    than when you first set out on this journey. Not sure how long you''ve been walking
    you turn around and can no longer see your ship. As you turn back towards the
    lights, they are gone. All you see in every direction is endless purple desert.


    Panic
    starts to take hold of you as you have no idea where you are, and no navigational
    tools of use. As you frantically look about you notice a figure approaching from
    atop a dune, tall, imposing and moving towards you fast...


    1. Approach
    the figure peacefully, arms raised and try to communicate.

    2. This is no
    time to be friendly, prepare to defend yourself and unsheath your combat knife.

    3.
    What the hell is that doing out here? Run!
