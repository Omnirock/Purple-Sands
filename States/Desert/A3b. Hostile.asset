  storyText: "With a firm grip on your knife, you brace yourself, standing your ground.
    You yell out \"Stop!\" and raise your free hand flat out hoping the figure understands.
    No change in speed, you can't see it's face or make out any features under the
    cover of the night sky, just a black shadow moving towards you fast. \n\nAs it
    comes across the dune you ready yourself, teeth clinched and blood hot you lunge
    the knife into the figure as it moves towards you. There is no resistance as
    you pass right through the darkness and fall onto the sand. You quickly rise
    to your feet and look around, only sand and stars across an endless purple sky.
    \n\nYour body tingles with a warmth even in this cold desert. Maybe it's the
    adrenaline you think to yourself and put your knife back in it's sheath. The
    light on the horizon seems to have returned as well. \n\n1. Time to focus and
    head out towards the light. (WIP/START OVER) \n2. What the hell just happened?
    Collect your thoughts and grab a snack."
