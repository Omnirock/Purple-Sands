  storyText: "You wake up with the worst ringing in your ears, surrounded by the
    shrapnel of what was once your ship. After a quick check, you are more or less
    in one piece. Having escaped death, you take a look around and see a purple hued
    desert that seemingly goes on for miles. In the distance you see what looks like
    lights from a small settlement. You gather what little supplies you can and start
    to march towards the lights when you notice the escape pod from your ship is
    still powered. The light in the sky is fading and the temperature is dropping.
    \n\nDo you:\n1: Enter the pod and try to make a communication.\n2: Keep moving,
    don't have time for this now."
