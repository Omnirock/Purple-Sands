  storyText: "With arms raised, you slowly move towards the figure.  You try to make
    out who or what the figure is at approaches, but all you see is a darkness against
    a dark purple sky. \n\nAs the figure closes in, you feel your fingers tingle
    and your body warms as if being embraced in a massive hug. You close your eyes
    expecting an impact, but there is no impact. You open your eyes, only endless
    dunes and night sky. \n\nStill not knowing where you are, you begin to wonder
    if you'll even survive this ordeal. Stumped and frustrated, you rummage through
    your pack and grab a ration and some water as you collect your thoughts. \n\n1.
