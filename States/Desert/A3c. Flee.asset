  storyText: "Seeing the figure moving fast, you begin running as fast as you can
    in whatever direction is away from that thing. Looking behind you, it's keeping
    pace and still following you. The desert is quickly growing colder, each breath
    you take seems to be harder and harder to make as you feel your extremities start
    to feel the effects of the cold. \n\nGrasping for air you:\n\n1. Drop your gear
    and extra equipment, surviving this is more important right now.\n2. Keep running,
    the figure must be getting tired of this too."
