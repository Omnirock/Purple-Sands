  storyText: 'Tearing through the package of your ration, you try to remember how
    you got here, what lead to the crash, and what happened to everyone else. Why
    were there no other bodies at the crash site, no footsteps or clues to their
    dissapearance. You struggle to remember anything before waking up in this desert.


    As
    you are trying to piece together your thoughts, you start to experience memories
    that are not your own, flashes of a city engulfed in fire. voices of people crying
    out in agony. You shake your head and try to focus back to your own thoughts
    when you are met with a voice that is not your own, deep in the back of your
    mind you hear it calling out, trying to free itself and gain control...


    1.
    Submit to the voice and see where this leads. (WIP) START OVER

    2. Resist,
    nothing good can come of this. (WIP) START OVER'
