  storyText: 'You quickly rip the pod door open and make your way to the console.
    The screen is damaged beyond repair and the inputs crackle with electric discharges
    from exposed wiring. A small personal radio still works, but has a very limited
    range. As you fiddle with the radio, you notice it''s almost dark and the temperature
    is dropping.


    1. Try to mess with the radio and electronics in the pod,
    maybe you can science the shit out of this...

    2. Gather the first aid kit
    and rations and get hiking, if I am going for the settlement, I need to leave
    now.
